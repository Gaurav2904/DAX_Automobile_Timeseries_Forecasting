This report is about using the data available on DAX index fetched from the finance platform named yahoo finance. From the DAX we are specifically focused on the automobile industry where my major focus on the stocks of three companies specifically, i.e., BMW, Volkswagen and Porsche. As later on Volkswagen was involved in the buyout of Porsche, this is what we are going to keep our major focus in the project and how this deal affected the entire German automobile industry. We have taken BMW stocks as keep track that how a major deal affected the entire market. It simply means that BMW is our market benchmark here, something we can compare our stocks as we make further progress in our project.
